#Algorithms 1

In this course, we will be taking a more mathematical look at algorithms, or methods of solving problems. We will introduce "computational complexity" and how to design efficient algorithms.

**Prerequisites:**

- Programming Concepts 1 & 2
- A good understanding of functions, logarithms, factorials, quadratic expressions, and exponential expressions

## Computational Complexity

Computational Complexity is a measure of how process, memory, and storage intensive a function or algorithm is.
