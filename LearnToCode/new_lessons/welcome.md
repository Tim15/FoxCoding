Programming is one of the most important skills of our age. It allows us to solve problems that were previously unfathomable. I hope these courses will help you can discover the joy and art of programming, as I have.

###Where to start?

Well, it depends on what you are interested in. 

####Static

If you would like to create a static website, then take the HTML and CSS courses.

*To be clear, a website is considered static when there is no interaction. This website is a static website because you just read information. Google is not, because you interact with it by searching for information.*

####Interactive

You should probably take Programming Concepts 1 to start off, as it will teach you to think like a programmer.

If you would love to create a mobile application that runs on your iPhone or Android, you will eventually want to get to C++ and Java.
